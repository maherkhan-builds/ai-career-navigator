# AI Career Navigator

**Industry:** Future of Work / Workforce Transformation / Career Intelligence  
**Part of 100-Day AI App Challenge**

## The Problem

Rapid AI adoption is displacing roles faster than workers can adapt. Many professionals don’t know which parts of their jobs are at risk, what future roles they could transition into, or which skills they should start learning now. Existing career tools rely on outdated job data and offer generic advice instead of forward-looking, personalized guidance.

## The Solution

An AI-powered career navigation app that predicts job disruption risk and recommends future-ready career paths:

- **Career Risk Analysis** – Evaluates how AI may impact a user’s current role  
- **Skill Gap Assessment** – Identifies which skills are becoming obsolete and which are rising  
- **Future Job Mapping** – Suggests emerging roles aligned with the user’s background  
- **Reskilling Pathways** – Recommends focused learning steps and skill transitions  
- **Actionable Career Plan** – Generates a clear, step-by-step roadmap instead of vague advice  

## Why This Can’t Be Done in ChatGPT

This app requires structured user inputs, consistent logic across sessions, and dynamic analysis of job trends and skill transitions. While ChatGPT can give general career advice, it cannot persist user profiles, compare multiple future pathways side-by-side, or generate a cohesive, personalized transition plan grounded in long-term workforce signals.

## Who This Is For

- Professionals in AI-disrupted or transitioning industries  
- Workers worried about automation and job displacement  
- Career switchers planning long-term reskilling  
- Students and early professionals seeking future-proof roles  

## Prompt Used

> Design an AI-powered career navigation app using Google App Studio that collects a user’s current role, industry, and skills, analyzes AI-driven job disruption risk and future labor-market trends, and outputs personalized career transition paths with recommended skills and learning steps.

## Tools Used

- Gemini + aistudio.google (ideation + prompting)  
- Google Stitch (UI design and prototyping)  
- Google Opal (UI design and prototyping)

## Time to Build

⏱️ ~25 minutes (from concept to working prototype)

## Revenue Potential

- **$10–25/month per user**
- High demand for career and reskilling tools  
- AI anxiety + workforce transition = strong willingness to pay  
- Ideal for B2C subscriptions or B2B workforce upskilling programs  

## Key Features

- AI-driven job disruption risk analysis  
- Personalized future career path recommendations  
- Skill gap and reskilling roadmap generation  
- Clear, human-readable career explanations  
- Fast, form-based UX for immediate value  

## What I Learned

Career uncertainty isn’t just a technical problem — it’s emotional. The app needs to reduce anxiety while still being honest about disruption risk. Clear language, focused outputs, and actionable next steps matter more than complex predictions.
